Title: Bag of Chars with d3.js
Description: Providing "bag-of-chars" statistics.
-->

This demo shows the interaction between a frontend input field, a `Python` backend that does a trivial analysis and a `d3.js` visualization of the analysis. So when you change the phrase, the frontend sends a message to the backend with the new input, which replies with a simple dictionary that is also shown in the `log` view below and the `d3.js` visualization is updated.
