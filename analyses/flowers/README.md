Title: Abstract Flowers
Description: Generate flowers. Parameters can be adjusted while the generation is running.
-->

There are various flower generators on the web. Most of them are prettier than this one here. This is a demo showing Databench's interactivity. The values of the sliders are propagated to the Python backend and are used to adopt the generation in real-time.

The real value is when using this example as a template to look at a stream of data you have in-house. Maybe the data is coming over `RabbitMQ` or `Redis` channels and you want to look at that stream in real-time and still be able to control filters on the stream.
